# Online Banking App

Online Banking App is developed by me and 3 of my friends inspired by existing models. The app leverages standard web technologies and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the following installed in your system:

    [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)

    [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally.
```
npm install -g @angular/cli@9.1.7
```

3. Clone the project locally into your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/openMF/online-banking.git
```

4. `cd` into project root directory and make sure you are on the master branch.

5. Install the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

6. To preview the app, run the following command and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
```
ng serve
or
npm start
```

The application is using the development server mobile instance with basic authentication by default. The credentials for the same are:
 
    Username - selfservice_imobile
    Password - password

**Important Note:** Please do not make any alterations to these credentials.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
